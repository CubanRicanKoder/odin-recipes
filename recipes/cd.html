    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The true origins of the very first corn dog may always be shrouded in
      mystery, but corn dog history seems to indicate that corn dogs are such a
      great idea, more than one person thought of it. Deep frying was invented
      by ancient Egyptians over 7,000 years ago, and battered, deep fried food
      has been around just as long. Once hotdogs baked in cornbread started
      showing up in diners, it wouldn’t be a big leap to think about putting one
      in a deep fryer. If you’ve ever known anyone with a deep fryer, you know
      the temptation to throw just about everything in there to see what
      happens.
