    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 cup (one measurement) of black beans</li>
      <li>5 cups (5 measurements) of white rice</li>
      <li>10 cups (10 measurements) of water</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>½ an onion</li>
      <li>¼ of a teaspoon of oregano</li>
      <li>¼ of a teaspoon of cumin</li>
      <li>½ a Laurel leaf</li>
      <li>½ a pound of bacon or chicharrones</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of oil or pork butter</li>
      <li>Salt as you like</li>
      <li>Water to soak the beans</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cover the dry beans with about four cups water in a two-quart saucepan.
        DON'T add any salt yet! Bring to a boil, and boil for 20 minutes. Remove
        from the heat and let it stand, covered for one hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and rinse the beans. Add enough water to cover once again and
        bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover and cook until tender, about
        45 to 60 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>Rinse the rice with cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
      <li>
        Use a large, eight-quart covered stockpot. Sauté the onion and green
        pepper in the olive oil until tender. Add the garlic, and sauté another
        minute or two. Add the tomato paste, black beans, oregano, cumin, bay
        leaf, and vinegar. Cook for about five minutes, stirring gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken stock and the rinsed rice. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
        to low, cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes -- until the rice is
        fully cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, adjust the seasonings by adding salt and pepper to taste.
        Remove the bay leaf. Serve Hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        For an added treat: Drizzle some olive oil (don't be stingy!) over the
        rice in the pot, and fluff cooked rice gently with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        If plating the rice as a side dish, drizzle a little olive oil over
        individual servings and garnish with some parsley or cilantro.
      </li>
    </ul>
