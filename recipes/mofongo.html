    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Plantain mofongo is thought to originate in Puerto Rico, and is a dish
      made from fried green (unripe) plantains mashed together with garlic and
      crackling pork rinds, also known as chicharr√≥n.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for frying</li>
      <li>3 medium green, unripe plantains</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
      <li>6 ounces pork rinds or cracklings, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat about 2 inches of oil in a frying pan or deep fryer to 350 F.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the oil is heating up, peel the plantains and cut into 1-inch
        rounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the plantains until golden and tender. This will take approximately
        4 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cooked plantains from the pan or fryer and allow to drain on
        paper towels
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the garlic paste in a mixing bowl or mortar and add the fried
        plantains. Mash until thoroughly blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pork rinds. Continue to mash and mix until all of the
        ingredients are well incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>Shape the mofongo into 4 balls.</li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can make the mofongo into a half-dome shape using a
        small condiment bowl as a mold; push a portion of mofongo down to the
        bottom of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>With the back of a spoon, smooth over and level off the mix.</li>
      <li>
        Then use the spoon to scrape around the bowl and remove the mash in a
        half-dome shape.
      </li>
      <li>Serve the mofongo hot and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
